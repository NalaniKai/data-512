# Data-512-A2
This is Megan Nalani Chun's second assignment for DATA 512 Human Centered Data Science. Last modified _____.

## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to identify sources of bias in a corpus of human annotated data and describe the implications of those biases by developing testable hypotheses about how these biases might impact the behavior of machine learning models trained on the data when those models are used for research purposes or to power data driven applications. 

## Steps to Reproduce 
1. Open the jupyter notebook [StepByStepNotebook.ipynb](https://github.com/NalaniKai/data-512/blob/main/data-512-a2/StepByStepNotebook.ipynb)
2. Follow the steps inside the notebook and run each cell in order, installing the specified libraries as needed. There are three main secions for:
- Step 0: Background research & gathering the data
- Step 1: Select and perform analysis
- Step 2: Discussing further implications

## Data Sources
The Wikipedia Talk personal attack and toxicity datasets used in this project can be found in [Figshare](https://figshare.com/projects/Wikipedia_Talk/16731).  

The [StepByStepNotebook.ipynb](https://github.com/NalaniKai/data-512/blob/main/data-512-a2/StepByStepNotebook.ipynb) notebook downloads and saves the data into the [data folder](https://github.com/NalaniKai/data-512/tree/main/data-512-a2/data) in Step 0.
